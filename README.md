Some minor warnings before "grading"
- Please ignore awkward jokes, somewhow even being alone and recording I was still nervous
- Please do not judge me based off my desktop, I like batman
- And Time became a little long so front end suffered a little.
- Forgot to create readme on video so it came later
- It was fun to use Django after so long!
